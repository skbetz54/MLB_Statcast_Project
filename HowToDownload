# Downloading your own baseballsavant data

This is a simple guide to download datasets that you can run these models to determine the accuracy for any given team, season, or any other criterion:

1.  Go to the [baseballsavant Statcast search] (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search).
2.  In the left-hand column, change "Player Type" to "Batter".
3.  You can also specify which team to use in this column.
4.  In the middle column you can specify which season(s) you would like to pick.
5.  Click "Search".
6.  Once the query is finished running, you will notice three logos on the right-hand side. Click the rightmost logo "Download Data as Comma Separated Values File".
7.  DO NOT click on the middle logo "Download Results...". This will not give you pitch-by-pitch data.
8.  Once the data is downloaded and saved, open the Python-compatible notebook of your choice (Google Colab, Jupyter, etc.).
9.  Import and clean the data according to the "Statcast - Data Cleaning" notebook in this repository.
